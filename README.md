# Deep Learning in Phylogentics

Project by:

 * Anne Hinrichs
 * Jorn Prenger
 
 Supervision by:
 
  * Jan Kotlarski (daily supervisor)
  * Richel Bilderbeek (supervisor)

## Research question

 * Can deep learning by used in phylogentics?
 * How can phylogentics benefit from deep learning?
 
## Prerequisites

 * What is deep learning?
 * What is a neural network?
 * What are neural networks used for?
 * What is an API?
 * What are pro's and cons of deap learning??
 * How to use Google's deep learning API?
 * What is phylogenetics?
 * What is a phylogeny?
 * How is a phylogeny inferred (and why do we use the word 'inferred' instead of 'concluded')?
 * What is a likelihood equation?

## Exercise to optionally do first

 * How to train a neural network to be able to do basic truth tables [Smith, 2017, advice 4]?

## End product(s)

 * A report in English, aimed at university students (so no need to explain basic mathermatics and terms)
 * Optionally: scripts, put on this GitHub

## Schedule

 * Monday: 
   * What are uses of deep learning? Optionally: simple scripts
   * 10:30 coffee break, 580
 * Tuesday: what is phylogenetics?
 * Wednesday: 
   * What are uses of deep learning in phylogenetics? Optionally: simple scripts
   * 9:30: talk Kasper Hendriks in Blue Room
   * 12:30: meeting with Franjo Weissing, room 578
   * afternoon: visit to the greenhouse with Jacob
