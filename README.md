# Deep Learning in Phylogentics

Project by:

 * Anne
 * Jorn Prenger

## Research question

 * Can deep learning by used in phylogentics?
 * How can phylogentics benefit from deep learning?
 
## Prerequisites

 * What is deep learning?
 * What is a neural network?
 * What are neural networks used for?
 * What is an API?
 * What are pro's and cons of deap learning??
 * How to use Google's deep learning API?
 * What is phylogenetics?
 * What is a phylogeny?
 * How is a phylogeny inferred (and why do we use the word 'inferred' instead of 'concluded')?
 * What is a likelihood equation?
