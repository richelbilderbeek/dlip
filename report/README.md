# The combination of phylogenetics and neural networks.

* Main question:
## Can deep neural networks be used in phylogentics and if so how can it benefit from it? 

* What is a neural network?

  
  
* Unsupervised:
  
  Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from unlabeled        data.
  
  Supervised
  
  Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data.
  



## What is a neural network used for?


 * Deep Learning for Population Genetic Inference.[1]

  Constructive Autoassociative Neural Network for Facial Recognition [3]



## What is deep learning?

* Wat deep learning is.

## What is a deep neural network?
 
  
  * A deep neural network is a neural network which uses multiple hidden layers. This type of networks can be used to execute far more complex tasks, but the layers also make the network almost impossible to understand.
