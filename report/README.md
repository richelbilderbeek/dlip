# Novel artificial neural networks applications in phylogenetics 

## Can deep neural networks be used in phylogentics and if so how can phylogenetics benefit from it? 
In this report we will examine if deep learning can be used for phylogenetics. We will also try to find out in what way they can be used, and try to give examples.

## What is a neural network?

A neural network is a massively parallel distributed processor made up of simple processing units, wich has a natural propensity for storing experiental knowledge and making it available for use. It resembles the brain in two respects:

1. Knowledge is acquired by the network form its environment trough a learning process.

2. Interneuron connection strengths, kwown as synaptic weights, are used to store the acquired knowledge. [7]

The procedure used to perform the learning algorithm, the function of wich is to modify the synaptic weights of the networks in an orderly fashion to attain a desired design objective.h 

### What is (un)supervised learning

* Unsupervised
  
Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from unlabeled        data.
  
 * Supervised
  
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data.

### What is deep learning?

Wat deep learning is.

### What is a deep neural network?
 
A deep neural network is a neural network which uses multiple hidden layers. This type of networks can be used to execute far more complex tasks, but the layers also make the network almost impossible to understand.

## What is an API

An API makes it easier for programmers to interact with hardware, databases and other stuff. It combines certain actions to save programmers from having to write the same standard code all the time. 
Just as a GUI makes it easier for people to use programs, API's make it easier for developers to use certain technologies in building applications. By abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs, an API reduces the cognitive load on a programmer.[5]
