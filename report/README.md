# The combination of phylogenetics and neural networks.*

## Can deep neural networks be used in phylogentics and if so how can phylogenetics benefit from it? 
In this report we will examine if deep learning can be used for phylogenetics. We will also try to find out in what way they can be used, and try to give examples.

## What is a neural network?

### What is (un)supervised learning

* Unsupervised
  
Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from unlabeled        data.
  
 * Supervised
  
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data.

### What is deep learning?

Wat deep learning is.

### What is a deep neural network?
 
A deep neural network is a neural network which uses multiple hidden layers. This type of networks can be used to execute far more complex tasks, but the layers also make the network almost impossible to understand.

## What are phylogenetics?

## What is an API
An API makes it easier for programmers to interact with hardware, databases and other stuff. It combines certain actions to save programmers from having to write the same standard code all the time. 
Just as a graphical user interface makes it easier for people to use programs, application programming interfaces make it easier for developers to use certain technologies in building applications. By abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs, an API reduces the cognitive load on a programmer. While a graphical interface for an email client might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file input/output might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occurring behind the scenes.[5]
  
*Just to be clear, all the neural networks we talk about are artificial, except for when we say they're not.
