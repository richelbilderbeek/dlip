# The combination of phylogenetics and neural networks.

## Can deep neural networks be used in phylogentics and if so how can it benefit from it? 

* What is a neural network?

  
  
* Unsupervised:
  
Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from unlabeled        data.
  
 * Supervised
  
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data.

Wat deep learning is.

## What is a deep neural network?
 
A deep neural network is a neural network which uses multiple hidden layers. This type of networks can be used to execute far more complex tasks, but the layers also make the network almost impossible to understand.

## What is an API
  * Just as a graphical user interface makes it easier for people to use programs, application programming interfaces make it easier for developers to use certain technologies in building applications. By abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs, an API reduces the cognitive load on a programmer. While a graphical interface for an email client might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file input/output might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occurring behind the scenes.[5]
